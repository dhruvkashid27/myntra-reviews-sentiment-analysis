Myntra Reviews â€” Sentiment Analysis (NLP + ML)

Overview:
This project analyzes Myntra product reviews and classifies them as Positive, Neutral, or Negative using TF-IDF vectorization and multiple ML models.
It also includes an interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions and bulk CSV uploads.

Features:
âœ… Text preprocessing & TF-IDF
âœ… Multiple model training (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
âœ… Model comparison & evaluation metrics
âœ… Streamlit App for real-time and bulk predictions
âœ… Train/Test CSVs included for reproducibility

Tech Stack:
Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, ML classifiers, metrics)
Streamlit (UI)
Seaborn / Matplotlib / WordCloud (visualizations)
Joblib (model persistence)

Run Locally:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/myntra-sentiment-analysis.git
cd myntra-sentiment-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

Deploy on Streamlit Cloud:
Push repo to GitHub (include app.py, model files, and requirements.txt)
Go to Streamlit Cloud â†’ New App
Select repo + app.py â†’ Deploy ðŸš€
App will be live at:
https://<your-app-name>-<your-username>.streamlit.app

Example Workflow:
Single Review â†’ Paste a review â†’ Predict sentiment instantly
CSV Upload â†’ Upload file with review column â†’ Get predictions + downloadable results
Model Performance â†’ Confusion matrix & accuracy metrics

Requirements:
streamlit
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
wordcloud
joblib
